# Continuous Safety Risk Evaluation by Example

This example illustrates continuous quantitative safety risk evaluation of an aircraft with a low criticality component that can affect overall aircraft safety.

A white paper in the Doc folder describes the different use scenarios for this example and the analysis results. 

You can also find a powerpoint presentation with the same material.

This example pretty much tracks the documents mentioned.
