		--@description The maximum time by which the Heat Source must be turned on or off to ensure acceptable operation of the Isolette system.
		--@rationale Since a closed Isolette will warm or cool at a maximum rate of 1�F per minute (EA-IS1 and EA-IS2), turning the Heat Source on or off within 6 seconds ensures that the Current Temperature will not have changed by more than 0.1�F, the required accuracy and resolution of the Temperature Sensor (EA-TS2).
